Quick Realtime Polls

## Overview

This webapp was created for a number of reasons. One was to provide a 
method for creating other sites like it.  Another reason was to be able to 
take quick polls and have the subsequent votes show up in real time, without 
having to reload the page.  And the final reason was to get a chance to try out 
LevelDB in an application.

## Installation

First clone the repo into a directory where you would like to host it and set 
the port environment variable to the port you want to run it on. In example
for bash:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:abemassry/express-polls.git
$ export PORT=80
$ node app.js

```
